Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
<em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.</em> Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
<em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
<em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
Until one day, you walk.<br>
One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
<strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
This. is. learning.<br>
It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>. Because the most <em>beautiful, complex concepts</em> in the whole universe<br>
are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
</p>
<p>
You only have to know <strong>one thing</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>You can learn anything.</em>
